About three months ago (January 2020) I started looking on the web for ways to make money from home;
I was surprised to see so many different avenues of income possibilities;
I quickly realized a lot of these programs were scams.
I was very depressed, but decided to not give up; 
once I realized I had to work hard and research what was out there, I began to see results. 
I became interested in finding a proven way to make money from home and then offer people the same opportunity.
My major in college is Human Resources; it's in my nature to help others better themselves; 
I have definitely been doing that since I started internet marketing. 
With the web flooded with several different ways to make money from home; 
it's important to separate yourself from those other programs like your own. 
What I try to do is point people in the right direction and allow them to lean on me for help. 
It's great having my own website but that's just something people see on a screen. 
I go a step further and allow people to contact me with any questions they may have; sometimes all people need is a little help.

Internet marketing is very competitive and if you don't know what you're doing, you're in big trouble. 
Working From Home Works!!! You just have to find that right person and program to help you get started. 
If you find a good program you can start out by putting in about 8 to 10 hours a week; 
once you start grossing some income you can step it up and make it your full-time job. 
I will be able to work from home full-time and use my degree to get a side job of my choosing as a hobby. 
Working from home is great but it's important to get outside and get away from your computer once in a while.
